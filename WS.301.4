Scrum - Manifesto Workbook
Problems with traditional (Waterfall) development.

With the Waterfall method, you have to wait until the entire code-base is production ready to push it out to the customer, which could cause issues in case the customer wants a change.

Agile Principles
1.	To satisfy the customer through consistent and early delivery of the software.
2.	To be able to be flexible with changing requirements, even late into development.
3. To consistently deliver the software to the developer.
4.	For the business side and the development side of the teams to consistently communicate about the project.
5.
To build trust around your team members and to have them motivated.
6.	To communicate face to face with your team members to communicate effectively.
7.	The progress is measured by whether the software is working.
8.	It promotes a sustainable environment, allowing the team to maintain a consistent pace indefinitely.
9.	To have continuous attention to technical excellence and good design, which enhances agility.
10.	And to maximize the amount of work that does not need to be completed.
11.	To allow best architecture, requirements, and design to emerge naturally as the team self-organizes.
12.	At regular intervals the team reflects on how to become more effective, which in turns adjusts their behavior accordingly.

Agile Framework Attributes
Focus on People	To expect professionalism to produce high quality outcomes.
Working Software	To deliver high quality software products.
Flexibility	To adjust to changing conditions.
Customer Involvement	Customers and user representative are expected to be involved within the development cycle.
Multi
disciplinary cooperating teams	Each Scrum team must have a deep understanding of one or two skills, while a broad but shallow understanding of many topics.
Trust	Trust is the fundamental aspect required for the teams to deliver the requested quality.

Agile Frameworks


1.	Scrum – The Scrum Framework is an empirical process where decisions are based on observations, experience and experimentation.
2.	Kanban – The Kanban Framework has it so the team has a continuous stream of work where the work items are pulled from a backlog.
3.	Extreme Programming (XP) – XP is an framework that focuses on producing higher quality software and higher quality of life for the development team.
4.	Feature Driven Development (FDD) – FDD is a framework that focuses on making progress on making features.
5.	Crystal – The Crystal Framework focuses on the team members and their interactions, mainly for short-term projects.
6.	Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM) – DSDM focuses on iterative and an incremental approach including continuous customer involvement.
7.	Rapid Application Development – This framework puts less emphasis on the planning process, and more so on the adaptive process, with prototypes being used.
8.	Adaptive Software Development (ASD) – This is a framework that emphasizes adaptability to respond to changing requirements and environments, with a focusing on learning.
9.	Disciplined Agile (DA) – It is used to guide the team members by using proven methodologies.
10.	Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) – It promotes alignment, collaboration, and delivery across a large number of teams, trying to implement Agile across large environments.
11.	Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) – Large scale scrum scaling agile across several teams all working on a singular project.
12.	Lean Software Development (LSD) – This framework is used to stream and optimize the software development process.

















Methodology	Framework
Agile’s methodology is to work on sections of the project in a 2 week sprint, communication with the business, customer, and dev teams consistently, as to minimize loss on time in case the customer wants something different or an issue comes up.	Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions.


Roles	Development Team, Scrum master, product owner

Roles are sets of responsibilities given to the team or individuals.
Rituals	Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Execution, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective, Product Backlog Grooming

Rituals represent active to be taken.
Artifacts	Definition of Done, Product Backlog, User Stories, Sprint Backlog, Burn-Down Chart, Task Board

Artifacts are documents that report some activity that will be performed by the team.
Rules	Rules are pre-defined behavior that teams or a control mechanism follows.
