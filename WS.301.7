Sprint Rituals
Sprint Planning Meeting	During a sprint planning session, the inputs are what the they need to accomplish before it’s finished, how is the product backlog, what commitments do they already have, and what are the velocity and capacity of the developer team.
Estimation	Estimating in Scrum is determining the expectations that can be placed onto the team to determine what amount of work will take in what amount of time.


   3 types of estimation 			When this occurs 		Unit of measure
Portfolio Backlog	Portfolio	As in, whatever unit of measurement the end product uses. Which could range from distance, to weight, or even time. Like T-shirt sizes.
Product Backlog	Product Backlog Grooming	Sprint Planning
Sprint Backlog Tasks	Story points / ideal days	Ideal hours / effort hours




Scrum Roles Involved in Estimation
